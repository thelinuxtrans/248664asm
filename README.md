# Unrelated Information: How does 248664ASM (LANG) work?

LANG uses a similar syntax to Assembly language, which is where the ASM comes from, it has a lot of functions you can use to control a computer at a very low level, these will be listed later down in the documentation.
LANG was made by 1 person (TheLinuxTrans) in 2024 (where the 24 comes from).
LANG is made for a "proprietary" CPU architecture made by TLT (TheLinuxTrans), this is currently avalible with the Python interpreter, but will be ported to an irl "computer" eventually ALSO made by TLT.








# Introduction: How to use 248664ASM

Lets start by explaining how to set up the development environment, first you will need the compiler, located at https://github.com/thelinuxtrans/248664asm

You need the Python language installed

Windows: Go to https://python.org/ and download Python by following the install process.

Linux:
	Arch: sudo pacman -Sy python



Now lets begin actually coding in LANG. You want to make a file in the 248664ASM folder you got earlier, call the file SOMETHING.asm (change the SOMETHING to whatever you want the program name to be).
Now once you have opened the file in any text editor (Nano, Vim, Visual Studio Code, etc.) you will need to know the functions avalible in LANG:

JMP				(Jumps to any memory address or register)
CMP				(Copies any memory address or register)
HLT				(Halts the CPU)
MOV				(Moves any memory address or register anywhere)
PUSH				(Pushes any memory address or register to the stack)
PRN {}				(Prints anything in the curly brackets)
